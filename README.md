### When to use Explicitly type (to not rely on inference)
- When a function returns 'any' type and we need to clarify the value
- When we declare a variable on one line and then initialize it later
- When we want a variable to have a type that can't be inferred
- Generally annotate return types of functions to avid forgetting to add a return statement
